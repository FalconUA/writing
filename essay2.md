The role of Artificial Intelligence in future technology
========================================================

In the past decades, the fields of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has demonstrated an astonishing performance in solving a wide spectrum of problems. 

The revolutionaly paper by Kryzhevski et. al. (2012), which Dr. Fei-Fei Li described as a "defining moment of the rennaisance of Deep Learning", has brought a rapid rise to the fields of Neural Networks and Deep Learning. Deep Neural Networks (DNN) were so effective at recognising the patterns in data comparing to statistical and linear optimization approaches and achieved such a huge success in different tasks, that it faded out the whole field of traditional Machine Learning. Public datasets such as ImageNet (Deng et al. 2009) and MNIST (LeCun, 1999) has made AI more available for individual researches, institutions and small companies, which resulted such a fast development of this field as we see today. 

Let's take a closer look at this state-of-the-art instrument of AI which resembles the visual cortex of human brain and the main problem that it have. Despite the unprecedented accuracy of DNNs on variety of pattern-recognition tasks, they are vulnerable to certain types of input data. For instance, Nguyen et al. (2015) showed that there is a way to generate a white noise that state-of-the-art DNNs believe to be recognisable object with 99% confidence. Goodfellow et al. (2015) demonstrated a method to change change the image of one class almost imperceptibly to the human eye in such a way that the DNN suddenly classifies it as any other class of choice, and argued that the primary cause of DNNs vulnerability is their linear nature. This raises a lot of security questions with AI-based automation systems, especially in the technologies directly related to human safety.

These works also shows that, although the field of Deep Learning is trying to mimic the structure and behaviour of human brain, there is a fundamental difference between the way DNNs and humans processes the input data from sensors. At current state, DNNs are, in essence, just an mathematical optimization tool. It does not have semantic understanding of data (e.g. visual objects). A full understanding of semantic information, ultimately, requires a certain sort of consciousness.

To sidestep the hard problem of consciousness, many attemts have been done in order to either implicitly or explicitly represent semantic knowledge within the AI system. Chomsky (1957) suggested a linguistics approach, according to which semantic knowledge can be represented by syntactic structures. Recently, complementing the concept of linguistics with pattern recognition, a new image database called Visual Genome (Krishna et al. 2016) was created, attempting to provide a deeper understanding of visual data, from pixel-level patterns to relationship between objects.
