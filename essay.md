Can computers think?
====================


Introduction
------------

The question of whether an artificially created machine or system can have a thought has been asked by greatest phylosophical minds for millenia. According to Hubert Dreyfus (1979), the works on artificial thoughts might begin around 450 B.C., when Socrates asked if there is an algorithm that can govern a rational mind. 

To avoid ambiguity in answering the question of this essay, it is important to define what we mean by "thinking". Thoughts can be understood in narrow terms as the process of deriving logical inferences from the given facts, or it can be discussed in much broader meanings as a consequence of consciousness. In the first part of this essay, I will make a brief review on previous mathematical and phylosophical results regarding the first definition, then the second part of this essay will be focused on discussing the works regarding the broader meaning of "thinking", as well as the problem in the current state-of-the-art AI technologies and the improtance of consciousness in future developmend of AI. 

The definition of thinking as the process of deriving conclusions using formal logic was first suggested by . Following this idea, Newell and Simon presented a reasoning program, the Logic Theorist, that was able to prove mathematical theorems. Later, Gelernter (1959) constructed the Geometry Theorem Prover, which, similarly to the Logic Theorist, can prove theorems using explicitly represented axioms.

**insert some more stuffs regarding the first definition**


The process of thinking can be viewed as a consequence of consciousness. Alexander (2005) suggested five features of conscious model, which appear important throught introspection.
