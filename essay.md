Can computers think?
====================

The question of whether an artificially created entity can have a thought has been asked by greatest philosophycal minds for thousands of years. According to Hubert Dreyfus (1979), the study on intelligence and artificial mind might be traced back to around 450 B.C., when Socrates asked if there is an algorithm that can govern a rational mind. From the next millenia of developments in philosophy, theories of reasoning and learning have emerged, along with the viewpoint that the mind can be constituted by the operation of a physical system. Modern mathematics came up with the theories of logic, probability, decision making, control, optimization and computation. Psychology provides us with the tools to investigate the human mind. Finally, state of the art nanoengineering along with computer science and neuroscience provides us with the tools and models to imitate the living brain more precisely than ever.

To avoid ambiguity in answering the question of this essay, it is important to define what we mean by "thinking". The problem of most of the works related to philosophy of thoughts is that they do not give a clear definition to the object they are discussing about.

In narrow terms, "thinking" can be understood as the process of deriving logical conclusions from the given facts and prior knowledge. Russel (1872-1970), governing the principle of induction, introduced the Logical Positivism -- a doctrine which holds that all knowledge can be characterized by logical theories applied on observation sentences that corresponds to sensory input. Following the logicism approach, Newell and Simon presented a reasoning program, the Logic Theorist, that was able to prove mathematical theorems. Later, Gelernter (1959) constructed the Geometry Theorem Prover, which, similarly to the Logic Theorist, can prove theorems using explicitly represented axioms.

To avoid ambiguity in answering the question of this essay, it is important to define what we mean by "thinking". Thoughts can be understood in narrow terms as the process of deriving logical inferences from the given facts, or it can be discussed in much broader meanings as a consequence of consciousness. In the first part of this essay, I will make a brief review on previous mathematical and phylosophical results regarding the first definition, then the second part of this essay will be focused on discussing the works regarding the broader meaning of "thinking", as well as the problem in the current state-of-the-art AI technologies and the improtance of consciousness in future developmend of AI. 

The definition of thinking as the process of deriving conclusions using formal logic was first suggested by . Following this idea, Newell and Simon presented a reasoning program, the Logic Theorist, that was able to prove mathematical theorems. Later, Gelernter (1959) constructed the Geometry Theorem Prover, which, similarly to the Logic Theorist, can prove theorems using explicitly represented axioms.

**insert some more stuffs regarding the first definition**


The process of thinking can be viewed as a consequence of consciousness. Alexander (2005) suggested five features of conscious model, which appear important throught introspection.
